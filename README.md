# Simple Trusting Shared Balance Sheet

This was my first attempt at using the Rust Yew library for web development. It uses an Actix backend hooked up to a mongodb database. 

Known issues:
- Mobile layout is terrible
- You need to refresh the page in order to have accurate breakdowns for prices
- You cannot edit multiple transactions at once (saving one will close the other transactions)
